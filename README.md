# IsolationAgrochemicals

The goal of this repository is to walk the user through the data analyses shown in “Impacts of agrochemicals and spatial isolation on the assembly and reassembly of temporary pond metacommunities”.

Here you can find the r code the run the results shown in the main paper for:

### Total Abundance
[Predatory insects](https://github.com/RodolfoPelinson/IsolationAgrochemicals/blob/master/Abundance_Analyses/Abundance_Analyses_Predators.md)  
[Non-predatory insects](https://github.com/RodolfoPelinson/IsolationAgrochemicals/blob/master/Abundance_Analyses/Abundance_Analyses_Herb_Det_Insects.md)  
[Amphibians](https://github.com/RodolfoPelinson/IsolationAgrochemicals/blob/master/Abundance_Analyses/Abundance_Analyses_Amphibians.md)  

### Community Structure
[Predators](https://github.com/RodolfoPelinson/IsolationAgrochemicals/blob/master/Community%20Structure/Community_Structure_Predatory_Insects.md)  
[Non-predators](https://github.com/RodolfoPelinson/IsolationAgrochemicals/blob/master/Community%20Structure/Community_Structure_Herbivore_Detritivores.md)

### Other analyses

These are the same analysis as above (only the main ones) but using different approaches, including comparissons between model selection through AICc VS frequentist Likelihood Ratio Tests, and mixed models using pond ID as random effect and pooling samples from the same pond together:

[Community structure of predators - Comparison of different approaches](https://github.com/RodolfoPelinson/IsolationAgrochemicals/blob/master/Response%20to%20reviewers/Community_Structure_Predators_approach_comparison.md)  
[Community structure of non-predators - Comparison of different approaches](https://github.com/RodolfoPelinson/IsolationAgrochemicals/blob/master/Response%20to%20reviewers/Community_Structure_Herbivore_Detritivores_approach_comparison.md)  
  

This is a simulation of the effect of pooling samples together:

This is an example of why we excluded really rare species before analyzing our data.
